## Initial Exposure
My first step into the Data Analysis World came through an opportunity with the Incubator Hub, through the initaitive, Ladies In Tech Africa that came to my notice via their social media handle ; *@theincubatornigeria*. I enrolled in data analysis and at the initial stage, the concepts felt foreign to me as i was coming from a non-technical background however, with the aid of the well-seasoned tutors, i began to appreciate the power of data in unravelling patterns.

## Courses and Programs
My learning program began on the **19th of August** and the following tools were used;
- Excel: We started with Excel, which helped me understand the basics of data manipulation, data cleaning, data entry and management. I learned to clean, sort, filter,and analyze data using the pivot table. I also learnt to use commands like  LOOKUP,Conditional functions...,and basic functions like SUM,AVERAGE, and IF statements.

- SQL : Next was SQL, I was introduced to SQL to query databases and retrieve specific data efficiently. Learning SQL taught me how to write queries to files, join, and aggregate data from relational databases. This is an essestial skill in understanding how interact with large datasets stored in databases.

- POWER BI : I also learned POWER BI, which is a powerful tool for creating interactive data visualizations and dashboards. With POWER BI, i was able to connect to various data sources, transform raw data, and build dynamic shareable reports.

  ## PROJECTS
  As i progressed through my data analysis journey, i worked on several projects that helped me apply the concepts and tools i have learned to real life scenarios. Here are a few projects that showcase my growth and the practical skills i have gained.
  1. Data Retrieval and Data Matching Analysis:
     This project allowed me use the LOOKUP function to match members of certain department in an organization to their grade level based on the allowances paid to them.
     
     -**Data Source:** I used the dataset provided by the organization
     
     -**Tools:** EXCEL

2. Aggregate Analysis:
   This project allowed me to perform aggregate functions (e.g COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN) to summarize data. This is useful for generating in sights such as total sales, average scores or the number of unique customer.
   -**Data Source**: The dataset was provided by the organization.

   -**Tools**: SQL
